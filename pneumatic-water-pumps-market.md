<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Dry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pneumatic water pumps market consists of two main types: submersible and dry pumps. Submersible pumps are designed to operate underwater, efficiently moving water from deep sources like wells or basements. They are ideal for drainage applications and can handle solids in the water. Dry pneumatic pumps, on the other hand, are situated above the water source and utilize air pressure to lift and transport water. These are typically used in applications where the water level is not excessively deep.</p></p>
